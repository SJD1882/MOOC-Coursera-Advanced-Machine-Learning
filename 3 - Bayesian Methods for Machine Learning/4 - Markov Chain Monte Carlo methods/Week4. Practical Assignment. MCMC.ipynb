Let's compute the **ratio** between the odds of a male having salary $\\geq $ \\$50K and the odds of a female (with the same level of education, experience and everything else) having salary $\\geq$ \\$50K. The first feature of each person in the dataset is the gender. Specifically, $x_{i1} = 0$ if the person is female and $x_{i1} = 1$ otherwise. Consider two people $i$ and $j$ having all but one features the same with the only difference in $x_{i1} \\neq x_{j1}$.\n",

So it would be really nice to build an interval estimate, which would tell us something along the lines \"with probability 0.95 the odds ratio is greater than 0.8 and less than 1.2, so we cannot conclude that there is any gender discrimination in the salaries\" (or vice versa, that \"with probability 0.95 the odds ratio is greater than 1.5 and less than 1.9 and the discrimination takes place because a male has at least 1.5 higher probability to get >$50k than a female with the same level of education, age, etc.\").
